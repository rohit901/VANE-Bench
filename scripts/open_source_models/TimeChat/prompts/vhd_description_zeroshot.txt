You are given a video from the {} dataset. Please find the highlight contents in the video described by a sentence query, determining the highlight timestamps and its saliency score on a scale from 1 to 5. The output format should be like: 'The highlight timestamps are in the 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100 seconds. Their saliency scores are 1.3, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.3, 1.7, 2.3, 2.3, 2.3'. Now I will give you the sentence query: {}. Please return the query-based highlight timestamps and salient scores.
