Be careful about your output format, you should provide timestamp and saliency score for the highlight moment. The output format should be like: 'There are 10 highlight moments in the 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100 second. Their saliency scores are 1.3, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.3, 1.7, 2.3, 2.3, 2.3'.
