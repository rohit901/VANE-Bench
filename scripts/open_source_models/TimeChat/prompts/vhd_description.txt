You are given a video from the {} dataset. Please find the highlight moments in the video described by a sentence query, determining the highlight moment's timestamp and its saliency score. The output format should be like: 'There are 10 highlight moments in the 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100 second. Their saliency scores are 1.3, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.3, 1.7, 2.3, 2.3, 2.3'. Now I will give you the sentence query: {}. Please return the query-based highlight moments.
